Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. Make sure you have TCL and readline installed on your system. (See
     below)

  2. mkdir build, the cd into it

  3. cmake ..

  4. cmake --build .

  5. cmake --install

  You can clean the build and start over just by removing the build
  directory.


Getting TCL
===========

	TCL is scripting language and interpreter released under a
    license very similar to the BSD license. cicb uses it to allow
    you to extend your client by writing scripts that you can embed
    in your .icbrc.

    The official release site is:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/files/Tcl/

    Fedora/Centos Linux variants: yum install tcl tcl-devel
    Debian/Ubuntu Linux variants: apt-get tcl8.6 tcl8.6-dev
    FreeBSD: pkg install tcl86
    MacOS: brew install tcl


Getting Readline
================

	Readline is library provided by GNU which facilitates getting
    user input from a command line.

	Many systems already have it installed, but if not you can get
    its source from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline, or use a system
    package manger to get it. For example:

    Fedora/Centos Linux variants: yum install readline readline-devel
    Debian/Ubuntu Linux variants: apt-get readline readline-dev
    FreeBSD: pkg install readline
    MacOS: brew install readline
	
    Many BSD-based OSes including Apple's OSX come with an incomplete
    readline package; more precisely, they come with libedit instead. 
    This has to do with the virusware gnu licensing of libreadline.

    At the moment (as of 5.1.2b1), a real libreadline is required. A
    fix is in the works to adopt libedit.

Default ICB Server Options
==========================

    To change the default server and port for cicb, use the following
    cmake options when you do the initial "cmake ..":

    cmake -DDEFAULT_PORT=7326

    cmake -DDEFAULT_HOST=\"some.host.comm\"


Building A Statically-Linked Binary
===================================

     By default, cicb is built as a dynamically-linked executable. If you want
     to build a statically-linked one, you can use the following option to
     `configure'.
